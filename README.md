# meterl
_Yet another macro system for Erlang_

======

Take a note this is still early draft / prototype. If I have enough time,
I shall develop meterl more.

## FAQ
1. What does __meterl__ mean?
  Meta-programming for erlang written geeky-way.
2. Why it does not...
  Because I didn't need it. Yet.

Big "thank you" to [Philip Robinson](http://chlorophil.blogspot.com)
for providing great tutorial on parse_transorm (see
http://readlists.com/4b363742 ), which taught me basics and inspired
to do things 'my way'.
